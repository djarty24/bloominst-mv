            <h3>Hi there, we&#x27;re Bloom Institute&#x27;s Mountain View Chapter!</h3>
			<p className='text-center text-gray-600'>In 2022, Bloom Institute expanded nationwide, introducing different regions to connect with students across the USA. ri, led the way and assembled our team: Dorie, Meredith, Katie, Catherine, and Jemma. Suri and Katie share a middle school background, while the rest of us attend Homestead High School in California. Once our team was formed, we eagerly began collaborating to plan exciting future eventsâ€” and it's been a blast! We can't wait to meet everyone and hope you all enjoy our events!</p>
