        <p>Within our events, we hope to touch on many unique topics by hosting workshops and seminars. We chose these non-traditional topics in hopes that students can find new passions, interests, and be able develop new hobbies. We believe that they are important in a student's creative development, which is why our team is working diligently to make sure this knowledge can reach as many students as possible.</p>
