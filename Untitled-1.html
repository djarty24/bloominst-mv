        Purpose
    </h1>
        <p1>
            Bloom Institute is a student-run non-profit organization aimed to promote non-traditional subjects to middle school students. In our region, we look forward to inspire and motivate students to learn about a variety of subjects. We want to provide students in the Mountain View area with fun and educational events that will help grow their interests for a successful future. We hope these events will help inspire many students to further pursue their passions beyond what is taught in a traditional classroom.
        </p1>
    <h2>
        Goals
    </h2>
        <p2>
            Within our events, we hope to touch on many unique topics by hosting workshops and seminars. We chose these non-traditional topics in hopes that students can find new passions, interests, and be able develop new hobbies. We believe that these subjects are important in a student's creative development, which is why our team is working diligently to make sure this knowledge can reach as many students as possible.
